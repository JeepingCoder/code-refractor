# <code-refractor>

## Description
 The code refractor is my first project done in out boot camp class showing our understanding and use of HTML,CSS and Git.

    This was done for hands on practice and to gain more knowledge of active coding
    The project was already built for me, but I examined and fixed the code to sharpen my skills and eye for what to look for in the future
    I was able to clean up HTML symantics, consolidate extra CSS content and enhance the user experience on the web page. 
    I learned to be patient and perservere. Also ASK FOR HELP! 

## Installation
Installation was done but pulling the code from GITLAB and doing a git clone to access code that neeed to be fixed

## Usage
To use the page clink the 3 links at the top of the page to navigate farther in the webpage. Also look at the tab to see the name of the company. 

## Credits
I collaborated with my Teacher's Asistants in class, used our office hours and specifically worked with Yon Bermudez to diagnose and rework some code that wasn't functioning correctly. I also used develop.moziila.org mulitple times to resolve issues I ran into also this site helped me with finding correct terms for symantic elements.
